# Python-Exam-Grader
I worked with a team to develop a Python Exam Grader. You can either login as a student or a teacher. If you login in as a teacher, you can create & grade exams. There is a question bank section that you can use to add questions to the exam. Once all the questions are added the exam can be posted for the student to take. Once posted, the student can take the exam and submit it. Once that occurs, the teacher can review the exam. There will be a table that displays the autograders score and the teacher has the option to keep that score or override it. Then, the teacher can come up with the final score of the exam and submit it back to the student to view. Unfortunately one of the team members deleted the backend of the application, so it does not function properly anymore. However, below I have attached a couple images of the setup.
